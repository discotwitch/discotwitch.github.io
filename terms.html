<p class="infotext" style="margin-top:100px"> Terms of Service for DiscoTwitch (referred to as "the bot"):</p>

<p class="infotext"> These Terms of Service ("Agreement") govern your use of the DiscoTwitch Discord bot (referred to as "the bot") and constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("User") and the creator or owner of DiscoTwitch (referred to as "the creator"). By inviting the bot to your Discord server or using the bot, you agree to be bound by this Agreement. If you do not agree with any part of this Agreement, you may not use the bot. </p>

    <p class="infotext"> Grant of License:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> The creator grants the User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the bot solely for personal or authorized purposes. The User acknowledges that the bot is a third-party application and that the creator has no control over Discord's terms of service or actions.</p>

    <p class="infotext"> User Responsibilities:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> The User agrees to use the bot in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations, and Discord's terms of service. The User is solely responsible for their use of the bot and any content or actions taken through the bot. The User agrees not to use the bot for any illegal, harmful, or unauthorized purposes, or for the use of harassment or brigading.</p>

    <p class="infotext"> Limitation of Liability:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> The User acknowledges that the bot is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis. The creator disclaims all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The User agrees that the creator shall not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or related to the use or inability to use the bot.</p>

    <p class="infotext"> Termination:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> The creator reserves the right to suspend, disable, or terminate the User's access to the bot at any time and for any reason, without prior notice or liability. The User may also terminate their use of the bot at any time by removing the bot from their Discord server.</p>

    <p class="infotext"> Intellectual Property:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> An "unused" version of the bot and all associated intellectual property rights, including but not limited to content, logos, and source code, are owned by the creator or its licensors. An "unused" bot refers to how the bot appears and acts before any interaction with a User. If a "used" bot, with content added to it by its User, mentions any content which is not owned or licensed to/by the creator, the creator takes no responsibility for the use of such content.</p>

    <p class="infotext"> Modifications:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> The creator reserves the right to modify or update this Agreement at any time, with or without prior notice. The User is responsible for regularly reviewing this Agreement. Continued use of the bot after any modifications shall constitute the User's acceptance of the modified Agreement.</p>

    <p class="infotext"> Entire Agreement:</p>
    <p class="infotext"> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the User and the creator regarding the use of the bot and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral.</p>

<p class="infotext"> If you have any questions or concerns regarding these Terms of Service, please contact us at <a href="mailto:contact.botjam@gmail.com">contact.botjam@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p class="infotext"> By inviting the bot to your Discord server or using the bot, you confirm that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.</p>
